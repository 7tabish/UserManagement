# Onion Architecture

* The Onion architecture addresses concerns related to the separation of components and the avoidance of tight coupling found in N-layered architecture.
* In this approach, each layer depends on the inner layer, with the domain layer serving as the core of the application.
* This architecture enhances testability compared to N-layered counterparts.
